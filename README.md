# MLB-Umpire-Scorecards

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to use the knowledge gained in class to analyze the accuracy of home plate umpires in Major League Baseball. The officiating is often under 
fire in this organization, and I wanted to see for myself whether this was warrented. In the baseball world, there seems to be a stigma that calls made by home plate
umpires, specifically those involving balls and strikes, have been getting worse in the past several years, to the point where the use of robot umpires has become a 
popularly debated idea. In this project, I wanted to test whether this was actually a reasonable conclusion, as well as analyze some other patterns in terms of umpire
accuracy.
